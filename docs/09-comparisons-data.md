## 3.1 Head-to-Head: Same Prompt, Different Techniques

**Task:** "Add error handling to this function"

| Technique | Prompt | ~Input Tokens | Output Quality |
|-----------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Verbose English | "Hey, could you please add comprehensive error handling to this function? I'd like it to handle all edge cases including null inputs, invalid types, and network errors. Please explain your changes." | ~40 | Good, but verbose output |
| Caveman lite | "Add error handling to this function. Cover null inputs, invalid types, network errors." | ~16 | Good |
| Caveman full | "Add error handling. Cover: null input, bad type, network error." | ~12 | Good |
| Caveman ultra | "Error handling: null/bad-type/net-err." | ~7 | Good (may need context) |
| Structured | `fn: add error handling\n- null input\n- invalid type\n- network error` | ~12 | Good |
| Code-centric | `# TODO: handle None, TypeError, ConnectionError` | ~8 | Good |

All six produce correct error handling code. The token costs range from 7 to 40. That's a **5.7x difference** for the same result.

> †A1/A2 output savings require system-level terse output instructions (see B5). Writing terse prompts alone saves input tokens; output tokens are only reduced if the model is instructed to respond tersely.

### The Big Winners

If you do nothing else, do these eight. Ranked by impact-to-effort ratio:

1. **Caveman-speak** — 30-50% input token savings; combine with B5 for 40-55% output savings
2. **Precise prompts** — 30-60% savings, just a habit change
3. **Code-only / constrain output** — 40-80% output savings, one instruction
4. **Shrink always-on context** (`copilot-instructions.md` + `AGENTS.md`) — compress filler, prune to landmines only, delete LLM-generated boilerplate. Compounds on every interaction and agent step; 20-23% agent-task reduction plus better correctness
5. **Ask Mode for simple questions** — 60-90% savings by avoiding Agent overhead
6. **Audit MCP servers** — disable unused servers, save 5K-190K tokens per agent task
7. **Convert non-text files to Markdown first** — avoid the DOCX/PDF/HTML format tax before content enters chat, agents, or RAG
8. **Retune prompts to target model guide** — not a per-request shrink; improves first-pass quality and avoids rework after model changes

## 3.4 Quality Impact Assessment

Does compression hurt output quality? The research says: **rarely, and only at extreme levels.**

| Compression Level | Quality Impact | Evidence |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Lite (drop filler) | None | Models trained on diverse text, understand clean prose |
| Full (drop articles, fragments) | Negligible | Models handle fragments well; technical terms preserved |
| Ultra (abbreviations, arrows) | Minor risk | Complex multi-step instructions may be misread |
| Wenyan (Classical Chinese) | Moderate risk | Models understand wenyan less reliably than English |
| Extreme (single words only) | Significant risk | Ambiguity increases, model may misinterpret |

**The threshold:** When you find yourself re-explaining or getting wrong results, you've compressed too far. Back off one level.

**Model-specific notes:** All major models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) handle caveman-full well. Ultra works for experienced users who know the domain. Wenyan is unreliable for code generation tasks.

### Diminishing Returns

The savings curve is not linear. The first 30% of compression (dropping filler) is free. The next 20% (fragments, abbreviations) is nearly free. Beyond that, each additional compression point risks quality.

Savings vs. Quality Risk:

Quality  ████████████████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░
Risk     ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░███████████████
         0%       20%      40%      60%      80%
                      Token Savings →
               lite     full      ultra    extreme
```

**Sweet spot: full caveman (30-50% input token savings; 40-55% output savings with terse system instructions).** Maximum return, negligible risk.
