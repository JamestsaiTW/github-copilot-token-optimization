## 2.2.1 The Token Economics of Human Languages

There's a persistent assumption: *"Write prompts in Chinese or Japanese — fewer characters means fewer tokens."*

**That does not hold up in token counts.**

Here is a sample comparison. Test sentence: "I met a huge dog" (and equivalents):

| Language | Sentence | Characters | Tokens | vs. English |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **English** | I met a huge dog | 16 | **5** | 1.0x (baseline) |
| **Spanish** | Conocí a un perro enorme | 24 | **8** | 1.6x |
| **Polish** | Spotkałem ogromnego psa | 23 | **8** | 1.6x |
| **Icelandic** | Ég hitti risastóran hund | 24 | **10** | 2.0x |
| **Chinese** | 我遇见了一只大狗 | 8 | **11** | 2.2x |
| **Japanese** | 大きな犬に出会った | 9 | **11** | 2.2x |
| **Russian** | Я встретил огромную собаку | 26 | **14** | 2.8x |
| **Hebrew** | פגשתי כלב ענק | 13 | **16** | 3.2x |

Chinese uses 8 characters vs. English's 16. But it costs **11 tokens** vs. English's **5**. More than double.

## 2.2.2 Why This Happens

BPE tokenizers are trained on data that is majority English. English text gets the best compression ratios because:

1. **Common English words → 1 token.** The tokenizer has dedicated entries for them
2. **CJK characters → ~1-1.4 tokens each** (not 2-3 as commonly claimed). Each CJK character is 3 UTF-8 bytes, and those byte sequences are less frequent in training data. That's still ~5-7x more expensive *per character* than English (~0.2 tokens/char), which is why 8 Chinese characters cost 11 tokens while 16 English characters cost only 5
3. **Non-Latin alphabets (Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic)** fare even worse — 2.5-3.2x English

## 2.2.3 Large-Scale Data

Across larger text samples (Capodieci/Castillo research):

| Language | Avg Token Cost vs. English | Characters per Token |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| English | 1.0x | 4.75 |
| Spanish | ~1.3-1.6x | ~3.5 |
| German | ~1.4-1.6x | ~3.2 |
| Mandarin Chinese | ~1.76x | 1.33 |
| Japanese | ~2.12x | 1.41 |
| Korean | ~2.36x | ~1.2 |
| Russian | ~2.5-2.8x | ~2.0 |

## 2.2.4 What About Classical Chinese (Wenyan 文言文)?

Classical Chinese is extraordinarily information-dense. Where modern Chinese might use 8 characters, wenyan might use 4. But the tokenizer doesn't care about information density — it cares about byte sequences.

**Example — "Explain database connection pooling":**

| Mode | Text | ~Tokens |
|------|------|---------|
| English (full caveman) | "Pool reuse open DB conn. Skip handshake → fast." | ~12 |
| Wenyan-full | "池reuse conn。skip handshake → fast。" | ~15 |
| Wenyan-ultra | "池reuse conn。skip→fast。" | ~12 |

At best, wenyan-ultra ties with terse English. At worst, it costs more. And the model understands English better because its training data is English-dominated.

**Verdict:** Wenyan modes are interesting for creative/educational purposes. They are **not recommended for actual token optimization.** Use terse English instead.

## 2.2.5 Practical Takeaways

1. **Always use English** for prompts and instructions. It's 1.5-3x more efficient than any other language
2. **Don't Google Translate your prompts** into CJK languages hoping to save tokens — you'll spend more
3. **If you're bilingual**, you might write more concisely in your native language, but the token cost will be higher
4. **Code output stays English** regardless of prompt language — variable names, comments, docs will be in English
5. **Transliteration helps** for non-Latin scripts — writing Russian in Latin characters cuts tokens ~50%

### The Transliteration Effect

Converting non-Latin scripts to Latin characters helps:

| Script | Sentence | Tokens | vs. Native |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Russian (Cyrillic) | Я встретил огромную собаку | 14 | baseline |
| Russian (Transliterated) | Ya vstretil ogromnuyu sobaku | 11 | 21% cheaper |
| Hebrew (Native) | פגשתי כלב ענק | 16 | baseline |
| Hebrew (Transliterated) | pgSti klv 3nq | 9 | 44% cheaper |

### Key Finding

> **English is the most token-efficient language for LLM prompts. Period.**
>
> CJK languages use fewer characters, but each character costs ~1-1.4 tokens.
> The net result is 1.7-2.4x MORE tokens than English for the same meaning.
>
> Don't write prompts in Chinese hoping to save tokens. You'll spend more.
